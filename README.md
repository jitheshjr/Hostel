# 🧾 Automated Mess Billing (Django)

A Django-based web application developed for the Women's Hostel in my college. It manages student data, tracks hostel attendance, and generates mess bills based on student absences. This helps reduce manual billing errors and streamlines hostel administration.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Student Information Management**  
  Store personal, and room-related details of hostelers.

- ✅ **Room Allocation**  
  Assign and manage hostel rooms for students.

- ✅ **Attendance Tracking**  
  Track daily presence or absence of students.

- ✅ **Mess Bill Generation**  
  Automatically calculates mess bills based on attendance records (absences reduce the bill amount).

  Easy-to-use interface for hostel staff to manage all operations.

- ✅ **Image Optimization**  
  Student profile images are auto-converted to WebP format and standardized dimensions.
